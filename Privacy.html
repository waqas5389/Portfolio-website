    <h2>Privacy First</h2>
    <p>Notezy is a personal, offline note-taking application developed by Waqas Ali. This app is built with user privacy as the top priority. Below is a clear and transparent explanation of how your data is handled.</p>

    <h2>Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>This app is intended for users aged <strong>13 and above</strong>. We do not knowingly collect or store any data from individuals under 13.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Notezy is <strong>not directed at children under the age of 13</strong>. The app does not include content designed for children, and it does not contain any features, ads, or services targeting children.</p>
    <p>Since the app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, there is no risk of accidental data collection from any user, including children.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All notes are stored locally on your device using Android’s secure internal storage and Room Database.</li>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
    <p>Notezy uses the open-source <strong>Compose Rich Editor</strong> library developed by <a href="https://mohamedrejeb.github.io/compose-rich-editor/" target="_blank">Mohamed Rejeb</a> to support rich text formatting features like bold, headings, and code blocks.</p>

      <li>It runs fully within the app and has no internet or analytics integration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We ensure that even external open-source tools we use follow strict privacy standards and do not compromise your data.</p>

    <h2>🔒 Zero Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Your notes stay on your device — they are <strong>never shared</strong>, <strong>never uploaded</strong>, and <strong>never tracked</strong>.</p>
